# AoC-2019
Advent of Code 2019, in Pony

**WARNING** While this code might work standard Pony, it is designed to take full advantage of the changes I have introduced in [my fork of Pony](https://github.com/KittyMac/ponyc/tree/roc_master). Most of the changes to Pony involve improvements to the Pony runtime. The list of these changes are documented in my [pony.problems](https://github.com/KittyMac/pony.problems) respository.
