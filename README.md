# AoC-2019
Advent of Code 2019, in Pony

**WARNING** While this code might work standard Pony, it might take advantage of customizations I've made in [my fork of Pony](https://github.com/KittyMac/ponyc/tree/roc_master). It might also rely on pony "packages" I've written, which the bundle.json just points to locally instead of the github repos.  If you actually want to compile these, you can find those package on this github under the same name ( for example, https://github.com/KittyMac/pony.stringExt )
